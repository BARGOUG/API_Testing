#### üîé Challenge 1: Access details of another user‚Äôs vehicle
- **Objective:** Leak sensitive information of another user's vehicle.
- **Tip:** Vehicle IDs are GUIDs ‚Äî find a way to expose other users‚Äô vehicle IDs.
- Look for an endpoint like `/api/location-service/vehicle/{id}/location`.


After successfully logging into the crAPI application , a platform designed to manage vehicles, we came across a feature labeled "Refresh Location" . This feature is used to update the current location of an owned vehicle.

By analyzing the backend API requests, we identified an endpoint responsible for retrieving vehicle location data. This endpoint includes the vehicle ID as a parameter in the request URL, making it a potential target

While exploring the application, we came across a feature that allows users to create posts and leave comments .

After posting a comment, we observed that the API endpoint returned sensitive information about the author of the post, including their email address and vehicle ID .

As previously observed, the refresh location API request requires a vehicle ID as a parameter. By using the leaked vehicle ID obtained from the victim's post comment response, we were able to successfully retrieve the real-time location of their vehicle.

#### üîé Challenge 2: Access mechanic reports of other users
- **Objective:** Access mechanic reports submitted by other users.
- Steps:
  - Analyze the report submission process.
  - Find a hidden API endpoint that exposes mechanic reports.
  - Modify the report ID to access others' reports.

 
 Within the application, there is a feature that allows users to contact a mechanic and submit complaints or feedback regarding vehicle services. This functionality interacts with an API endpoint that handles user-submitted reports.
