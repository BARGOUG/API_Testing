 Broken Object Level Authorization short for BOLA  is a security vulnerability commonly found in APIs, where a user can access or modify data that belongs to someone else.As part of our study on API security, we implemented a test environment using crAPI , a vulnerable-by-design API platform, to demonstrate the exploitation of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) . This practical approach helps illustrate how such vulnerabilities can be leveraged by attackers in real-world applications.
