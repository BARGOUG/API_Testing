## 🔍 Overview
A business logic flaw is a mistake in how a website, app, or service is designed to work — not in its code, but in how it handles real-life situations.
It happens when someone uses the system in a way that wasn’t intended , but still follows the rules enough to get an unfair advantage — like getting something for free, doing something they shouldn’t be allowed to do, or tricking the system into giving them more than they deserve.
