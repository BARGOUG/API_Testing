In the shop menu, we noticed that items such as a wheel are available for purchase at a price of $10.

Clicking the 'Buy' button triggers a request that includes the product_id and quantity as input parameters.

Following the observed logic, purchasing one item (quantity of 1) deducts $10 from the balance. Therefore, buying 10 units should deduct $100. However, when we experimented with entering a negative quantity , such as -100, the system processed the request and instead added $1000 to our balance .

This demonstrates a business logic flaw in the application â€” specifically, the system fails to properly validate input values (like quantity), allowing users to manipulate the purchase process in unintended ways. Entering a negative number should either be blocked or handled correctly by the system, not used to increase a user's balance fraudulently.
