# üîê API-Security-Testing ‚Äì OWASP API Top 10 Based Assessment

## üìñ Introduction

This repository is dedicated to conducting comprehensive **API security testing** aligned with the **[OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)**.  The goal is to identify and remediate common security risks in RESTful and GraphQL APIs by systematically evaluating them against the most critical threats defined by OWASP.

As modern applications increasingly rely on APIs for communication between services, ensuring their security has become crucial. This lab provides a structured approach to testing APIs for vulnerabilities such as broken authentication, insecure endpoints, insufficient logging, and more.
